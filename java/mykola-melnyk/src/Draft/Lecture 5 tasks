Coding tasks

1. Create a method that accepts an integer N and a variable amount of other integer numbers. The method needs to return the value of the Nth (1-based) smallest element in the array. Return -1 if the amount of passed integers is less than N.
Input: 4, 1, 5, 2, 3, 7
Output: 5 (the 4th smallest number in the array 1, 5, 2, 3, 7 is 5: 1 2 3 5 7)
Input: 3, 1, 2
Output: -1


2. Create a generic method that accepts a list of values (not only numbers) and returns the max value.
Input:  1, 5, 7, 3, 5
Output:


3. Create a method that accepts a list of words, and displays only unique one (order can be random). Bonus task: treat strings in a different case as the same one: “Apple” and “apple” should be treated as the same string (don’t use any methods that create a new string object - like toUpperCase or toLowerCase - you can work only with a given input).
Input: [“apple”, “orange”, “pear”, “apple”, “banana”, “orange”]
Output: apple
			orange
			pear
			banana


4. Create a method that accepts a string, counts all unique non-space character occurrences and displays each character with an amount of occurrences (output should be sorted by a character value in ascending order). Also, add a couple of examples that use your method.
Input: “Hello World”
Output: H - 1
W - 1
d - 1
e - 1
l - 3
o - 2
r - 1


5. Create a class KthLargest with a single method int add(int value) that accepts a value and returns the kth largest value in a stream of numbers (the amount of numbers is increasing). Number k should be passed during the object construction. Return -1 if the number of values seen so far is less than k.
new KthLargest(2)
add(1) // -1
add(2) // 1
add(5) // 2
add(6) // 5
add(4) // 5
